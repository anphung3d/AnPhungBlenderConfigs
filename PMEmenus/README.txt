Requires the Blender addon: Pie Menu Editor ($commercial)

This is quickly exported out of Pie Menu Editor without much organization, use at your own sanity.
Remember to back up/ export your own menus before importing mine. 

Includes panel groups, popup dialogs, macros, stack keys, pies, regular menu, properties.

I use these menus together with a custom keymap so some of these might not work as expected if you don't use my custom keymap.

Not all menus included are used.
