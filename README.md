Free to share, modify, use

config folder goes to: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.80

keyconfig & interface_theme folders go to: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.80\scripts\presets

NOTE: Back up your stuff before replacing them with mine.
Or create a folder named "config" in for example: C:\Program Files\Blender\blender-2.80.0-git.19dcb22a885d-windows64\2.80
and put my stuff in there. This way your configs won't be affected.
Blender 2.8 only.
